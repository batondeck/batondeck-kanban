# Changelog

Notable changes to batondeck-kanban. The format follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and this project will use
[semantic versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html) from its first release.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- `internal/domain`: the six ticket statuses and the fixed transition table (same-status moves
  legal; `CANCELLED` and `DEAD_LETTER` refused as `VALIDATION`), with allowed-next and shortest-path
  guidance on `INVALID_TRANSITION`; the error model (13 codes, `STALE`, `RATE_LIMITED` and `INTERNAL`
  retryable); the move decision (WIP limit on entering IN_PROGRESS, a promotion with open blockers
  landing on BLOCKED, reorder within a column); order keys ported from fractional-indexing 4.0.0;
  dependency cycle detection (`CYCLE_DETECTED`). Pure functions, not yet called by any tool.
- The skeleton, copied from hdtp-gateway and stripped of HDTP: the Go module
  `github.com/batondeck/batondeck-kanban`; the `batondeck-kanban` binary with `serve`, `healthcheck`
  and `version` (`token` and `user` exit 2, not implemented in this release; `migrate` and `doctor` below);
  `serve` answers `GET /healthz` with the binary and its version and serves the embedded web UI
  placeholder; config from `BATONDECK_*` > a JSON file > defaults, holding `database.url`,
  `database.synchronous`, `listen` and `public_url`; the data-dir lock, admin socket and keyring;
  the SQLite and Postgres engines with goose's migration machinery, no migration yet and no
  area; the Makefile gate
  (`make check`: fmt vet staticcheck notices-check release-check test), the githooks, the
  distroless Dockerfile, THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES and RELEASING.md.
- The store engine pair, wired: `database.url` (`BATONDECK_DATABASE_URL`) unset or a file path opens
  SQLite (WAL, `_txlock=immediate`, `busy_timeout=5000`, `synchronous` FULL or the NORMAL opt-in) with
  one write connection and a `query_only` read pool of four; a `postgres://` URL opens a pgx pool with
  goose's session lock. `Store` gains `Atomically` and `ServerVersion`, and `Migrate` reports what it
  did; with no migration in the binary it creates goose's version table alone. `batondeck-kanban
  migrate` runs the migrations, `serve` runs them before it listens, and `doctor` reports the engine
  the connection answers as (`sqlite_version()` / `version()`), exiting 1 and naming the engine when
  there is none. The conformance suite holds its first area, the lifecycle, and runs on SQLite and on
  Postgres (`BATONDECK_TEST_POSTGRES_DSN`; skipped when unset, failing when unreachable) as
  `make conformance`, a step of `make check`. THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES now covers the 20 modules the
  binary links.
- The gate: `pre-commit` scans the INDEX for credentials (`scripts/check-secrets.py`; a documented
  fake carries `secret-scan-ok: <reason>`, and a marker with no reason fails); `pre-push` starts
  `postgres:16-alpine` in Docker, exports `BATONDECK_TEST_POSTGRES_DSN` and runs `make check`,
  refusing the push when Docker is absent; `make check` gains `sqlc-check` and `web-dist-check`
  (each prints a skip line until `queries/*.sql` and `web/package.json` exist); a GitHub Actions
  `check` workflow runs `make check` on pull requests against a `postgres:16` service.
