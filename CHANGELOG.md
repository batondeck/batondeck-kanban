## [Unreleased]

### Added

- The skeleton, copied from hdtp-gateway and stripped of HDTP: the Go module
  `github.com/batondeck/batondeck-kanban`; the `batondeck-kanban` binary with `serve`, `healthcheck`
  and `version` (`migrate`, `token`, `user` and `doctor` exit 2, not implemented in this release);
  `serve` answers `GET /healthz` with the binary and its version and serves the embedded web UI
  placeholder; config from `BATONDECK_*` > a JSON file > defaults, holding `database.url`,
  `database.synchronous`, `listen` and `public_url`; the data-dir lock, admin socket and keyring;
  the SQLite and Postgres engines with goose's migration machinery, no migration yet and no
  area; the Makefile gate
  (`make check`: fmt vet staticcheck notices-check release-check test), the githooks, the
  distroless Dockerfile, THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES and RELEASING.md.
- The MCP contract, before any tool exists: `contract/tools.json` (conductor's published
  `docs-site/mcp.json` at `5e2baafa`, 130 tools with input and output schemas, its 4 prompts and 10
  resource templates) and `contract/admin-tools.json` (`list_audit_log`, from an admin `tools/list`
  of the same build), both written by `scripts/contract-import.mjs`; `contract/canonical.go`, which
  reduces a JSON Schema to its typeSet, enum, items, properties, required and
  additionalProperties; `contract/deltas.json`, every departure from conductor (40 removed tools,
  3 removed properties, 120 removed `CANCELLED`/`DEAD_LETTER` enum values, `delete_task` added,
  `deadLetter` renamed `poisoned` twice); `contract/expected.json`, the derived 92-tool surface;
  `contract/errors.json`, conductor's 13 error codes and the error payload. `make check` runs the
  new `contract` step, which refuses an `expected.json` that is not the exact derivation, a surface
  carrying `get_transitions`, `set_transitions` or `requeue_task`, and one without `delete_task`.
